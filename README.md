# 🪐 Personal Portfolio

## 🚀 Overview
Welcome to my personal portfolio—a creative space that highlights my skills, projects, and design philosophy. Built with React and Tailwind CSS, this site combines dynamic animations with a clean, responsive UI. From theme toggles to interactive project cards, everything is crafted to reflect technical precision and visual storytelling.

## 📌 Features

- 🌗 **Theme Toggle**: Light/dark mode with system preference detection and local storage support.
- ✉️ **Contact Form**: Integrated with EmailJS for seamless email submissions without a backend.
- 🌤 **Animated Atmosphere**: Floating suns, drifting clouds, meteor showers, and glowing stars—all driven by custom keyframes and HSL gradients.
- ✨ **Custom Animations**: Typewriter intro, fade-ins, and hover effects for immersive interactivity.
- 📱 **Responsive Layout**: Optimized across devices using utility-first Tailwind CSS styling.
- 🧩 **Reusable Components**: Modular React components for scalability.
- 📂 **Project Showcases**: Hoverable project cards with links to GitHub and live demos.
